## Introduction üåêüõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the AutoProfix Garage Management System repository! This project is designed to help Harold, the owner of "AutoProfix," a thriving auto repair shop in an idyllic countryside town, modernize his garage management operations. With the increasing customer base, it's time to transition from the traditional pen-and-paper approach to a web-based solution. using a code to database approch and scaffolding the controllers and views from the models

## Assignment Context üìã

### Garage Management Challenge
Harold, the owner of a successful auto repair business named "AutoProfix" in a picturesque countryside town, is facing a challenge. His customer base has been steadily growing, and the traditional pen-and-paper method of managing the garage's operations is no longer efficient. To address this, he's considering modernizing the garage management system by implementing a web-based solution.

Here are the key points of the challenge he's facing:

- **Vehicle Registration**: Harold wants a system that can capture detailed information about each vehicle, including brand, model, year, chassis number, mileage, and maintenance status.

- **Maintenance Management**: Keeping track of all repairs and maintenance services, including dates, costs, and work done, is crucial.

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Manual appointment scheduling is time-consuming. How can the process be improved?

- **Invoicing and Payments**: Generating invoices for customers and tracking payments are essential.

- **Customer Management**: Maintaining customer data, including contact information and vehicle history, is important.

- **Inventory Management**: Managing the stock of necessary parts and materials is vital.

- **Reporting and Analyses**: Harold would like insights into financial data, performance metrics, and maintenance history. How can a digital system help generate useful reports and analyses?

- **Security**: Ensuring customer data is secure and protecting the system from potential threats is a top priority.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

:warning: **Not a Finished Production System**: This project represents an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) created to demonstrate the implementation of concepts covered in web application lectures. It intentionally refrains from going beyond the instructed scope to avoid unnecessary complexity. Please note that this is not a fully polished or production-ready application but serves as a foundation for further development and learning.

Here's an organized project structure to consider for your ASP.NET Core MVC application:

1. **Project Root**:
   - `appsettings.json` or configuration files.
   - `Program.cs` and `Startup.cs`.

2. **Controllers**:
   - Create a folder for your controller classes. This is where you'll define the actions that handle incoming HTTP requests.

   In your project, you have the following controllers:

   - **MVC Controllers**:
     - `CustomerController`: Handles operations related to customers in your web application.
     - `HomeController`: Manages the main home page and general site navigation.
     - `InventoryItemController`: Deals with inventory items in your application.
     - `InvoiceController`: Manages invoice-related actions and views.
     - `MaintenanceRecordController`: Handles maintenance record operations.
     - `PaymentController`: Controls payment-related functionalities.
     - `UserController`: Manages user-related actions, likely for authentication and user management.
     - `VehicleController`: Handles operations related to vehicles in your application.

   - **API Controllers**:
     - `CustomerApiController`: Provides a RESTful API for CRUD operations on customer data. For example, you can use the following URL to retrieve customer data: `GET http://localhost:5137/api/CustomerApi/2`.
     - `VehicleApiController`: Offers a RESTful API for CRUD operations on vehicle data. You can access vehicle information using the API, e.g., `GET http://localhost:5137/api/VehicleApi/2`.
   
3. **Views**:
   - Organize your views within a folder structure that follows your controller organization. Views are responsible for rendering HTML templates and presenting data to users.

   In this project, you have the following views organized by their respective controllers:

   - **Customer Views**:
     - `Customer`: Views related to customer operations.
     
   - **Home Views**:
     - `Home`: Main home page and general site content.
     
   - **InventoryItem Views**:
     - `InventoryItem`: Views for inventory item management.
     
   - **Invoice Views**:
     - `Invoice`: Views for invoice-related actions and display.
     
   - **MaintenanceRecord Views**:
     - `MaintenanceRecord`: Views related to maintenance record management.
     
   - **Payment Views**:
     - `Payment`: Views related to payment operations.
     
   - **Shared Views**:
     - `Shared`: Common shared views that can be reused across multiple controllers.
     
   - **User Views**:
     - `User`: Views for user management and authentication.
     
   - **Vehicle Views**:
     - `Vehicle`: Views related to vehicle operations.

4. **Models**:
   - Create an `Entities` folder to store your entity classes. These classes represent the data structure of your application and are often mapped to database tables.

   In your project, you may have the following models:

   - **Customer Model**:
     - Represents customer data and attributes.
   
   - **ErrorViewModel Model**:
     - Typically used for error handling and displaying error messages in views.

   - **InventoryItem Model**:
     - Represents information about items in your inventory.

   - **Invoice Model**:
     - Represents invoice data, including line items and total amounts.

   - **MaintenanceRecord Model**:
     - Represents records of maintenance activities.

   - **Payment Model**:
     - Represents payment information for transactions.

   - **User Model**:
     - Represents user data and attributes, often used for authentication and user management.

   - **Vehicle Model**:
     - Represents information about vehicles, including make, model, and other relevant details.

   These models define the structure of your data and play a crucial role in interacting with your database and rendering views. Organizing them in an `Entities` folder helps maintain clarity in your project structure.
   
5. **Data**:
   - `ApplicationDbContexts` folder: Contains your Entity Framework context classes.
   - `Migrations` folder: Contains database migration files generated by Entity Framework.
     
6. **wwwroot**:
   - Store your static files like JavaScript, CSS, and images in this folder.

7. **Tests** (optional):
    - Create folders for unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.
