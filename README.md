## Introduction üåêüõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the AutoProfix Garage Management System repository! This project is designed to help Harold, the owner of "AutoProfix," a thriving auto repair shop in an idyllic countryside town, modernize his garage management operations. With the increasing customer base, it's time to transition from the traditional pen-and-paper approach to a web-based solution.

## Assignment Context üìã

### Garage Management Challenge
Harold, the owner of a successful auto repair business named "AutoProfix" in a picturesque countryside town, is facing a challenge. His customer base has been steadily growing, and the traditional pen-and-paper method of managing the garage's operations is no longer efficient. To address this, he's considering modernizing the garage management system by implementing a web-based solution.

Here are the key points of the challenge he's facing:

- **Vehicle Registration**: Harold wants a system that can capture detailed information about each vehicle, including brand, model, year, chassis number, mileage, and maintenance status.

- **Maintenance Management**: Keeping track of all repairs and maintenance services, including dates, costs, and work done, is crucial.

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Manual appointment scheduling is time-consuming. How can the process be improved?

- **Invoicing and Payments**: Generating invoices for customers and tracking payments are essential.

- **Customer Management**: Maintaining customer data, including contact information and vehicle history, is important.

- **Inventory Management**: Managing the stock of necessary parts and materials is vital.

- **Reporting and Analyses**: Harold would like insights into financial data, performance metrics, and maintenance history. How can a digital system help generate useful reports and analyses?

- **Security**: Ensuring customer data is secure and protecting the system from potential threats is a top priority.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

Here's an organized project structure to consider for your ASP.NET Core MVC application:

1. **Project Root**:
   - `appsettings.json` or configuration files.
   - `Program.cs` and `Startup.cs`.

2. **Controllers**:
   - Create a folder for your controller classes.
   
3. **Views**:
   - Organize your views within a folder structure that follows your controller organization.

4. **Models**:
   - Create an `Entities` folder to store your entity classes.
   
5. **Data**:
   - `DbContexts` folder: Contains your Entity Framework context classes.
   - `Migrations` folder: Contains database migration files generated by Entity Framework.

6. **Repositories** (optional):
   - If you want to separate your data access logic, create a `Repositories` folder here.

7. **Services**:
   - Implement business logic in a `Services` folder.

8. **Utilities or Helpers**:
   - If you have utility classes or custom helpers, place them here.

9. **wwwroot**:
   - Store your static files like JavaScript, CSS, and images in this folder.

10. **Areas** (if needed):
    - If your MVC application has distinct functional areas (e.g., Admin, User), you can organize controllers, views, and models within separate "Areas" folders.

11. **Tests** (optional):
    - Create folders for unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.

12. **Logs and Resources** (optional):
    - If needed, create folders to manage logs or external resource files.

## Development Steps üìù

Building an ASP.NET Core MVC application involves several key steps:

1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
   - Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.

2. **Create a New ASP.NET MVC Project**:
   - Choose the "MVC" template.

3. **Define Your Models**:
   - Create C# classes to represent your data entities.

4. **Create a DbContext**:
   - Define an Entity Framework DbContext class for database connectivity.

5. **Configure Dependency Injection**:
   - Set up dependency injection in `Startup.cs` to inject services and repositories.

6. **Create Controllers**:
   - Handle HTTP requests by creating controllers and actions.

7. **Create Views**:
   - Develop Razor views (.cshtml files) for rendering HTML templates.

8. **Implement Routing**:
   - Configure URL routing in `Startup.cs` to map URLs to controller actions.

9. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - Create methods in controllers for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

10. **Apply Validation**:
    - Add data validation to models using annotations or custom logic.

11. **Implement Authentication and Authorization** (if needed):
    - Configure user authentication and authorization.

12. **Testing**:
    - Write unit tests for controllers and services using testing frameworks like xUnit or NUnit.

13. **Logging**:
    - Configure logging for debugging and monitoring.

14. **Styling and Client-Side Scripts**:
    - Enhance UI with CSS styles and client-side scripts.

15. **Deployment**:
    - Prepare for deployment to a web server or cloud platform.

16. **Testing in a Production-Like Environment**:
    - Ensure your app functions correctly in a staging environment.

17. **Documentation**:
    - Create documentation including installation instructions and usage guides.

18. **Optimization**:
    - Optimize for performance and scalability.

19. **Security**:
    - Implement security best practices.

20. **Monitoring and Error Handling**:
    - Set up monitoring and error tracking.

21. **Launch**:
    - Deploy your app to production.

22. **Maintenance**:
    - Regularly maintain and update your app.

## Diagrams and Designs üìäüé®

As you work on your AutoProfix Garage Management System, consider creating visual representations of your system's architecture, database schema, or user interface designs. Diagrams and designs can greatly aid in project understanding, planning, and documentation. Here are some types of diagrams and designs you may want to include:

1. **System Architecture Diagrams**: Visualize how different components of your application interact with each other, including the MVC structure, middleware, and external services.

2. **Database Schema Diagrams**: Create Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or similar representations to illustrate your database structure, including tables, relationships, and constraints.

3. **Wireframes and Mockups**: Design the user interface of your application using wireframes or mockups to outline the layout and user interaction flow.

5. **Flowcharts**: Create flowcharts to depict complex processes or workflows within your application, such as appointment scheduling or maintenance workflows.

6. **Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrate the sequence of interactions between different components or actors in your system, useful for understanding complex scenarios.

7. **Use Case Diagram**: Visualizes the use cases per actor.
